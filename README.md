Hi! My name is Chris. 

I'm a CS student, web developer and [AB-Blooded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type#ABO_blood_group_system) person.

I always wanted to create something like this but well many things should be done first. It's December now, final exam is finished, so... YAY!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. ANYTHING!

- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
- Use only Bahasa Indonesia or English.
